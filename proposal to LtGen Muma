### Subject: Proposal for Digital Menu Solution Using QR Codes

---

Introduction:

We, at Osabox Limited, are excited to present a proposal to digitize your restaurant menu by developing a QR code solution. As a progressive restaurant that delivers a delightful dining experience, Bojungles can further enhance customer convenience by transitioning from traditional hardcover menus to a modern, eco-friendly QR code system. This solution will provide your guests with a seamless and interactive experience, allowing them to easily browse your full menu using their smartphones.

---

### Proposed Solution:

We propose creating a custom QR Code Menu System for Bojungles Restaurant, which will have the following features:

1. Digital Menu Access:
   - A QR code will be placed on each table and at the entrance of the restaurant.
   - Upon scanning the code, guests will instantly access a mobile-friendly digital version of your menu.
   - The menu will display the dishes along with photos, descriptions, and pricing, just like your hardcover menus.

2. Interactive Menu with Updates:
   - The digital menu can be easily updated in real time, allowing for changes in pricing, availability, or new seasonal offerings without the need to reprint physical menus.
   - Special promotions, daily offers, or chefâ€™s recommendations can be highlighted instantly.

3. Customer Reviews:
   - A review section will be integrated with the QR code, enabling customers to leave feedback about their dining experience.
   - This will help you gather valuable insights and provide guests with the opportunity to interact with your brand on a deeper level.

4. Enhanced Customer Experience:
   - The QR code system will reduce the handling of physical menus, creating a more hygienic environment for guests, which is crucial in the current health-conscious world.
   - An intuitive interface will ensure that your guests have a smooth experience navigating the menu.

5. Sustainability:
   - By eliminating the need for printed menus, Bojungles will reduce paper usage, contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.

### Project Scope and Timeline:

- Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Menu Design (1 week): We will meet with your team to collect all the necessary details about your menu, including item descriptions, photos, and special categories.
  
- Phase 2: QR Code Generation and Digital Platform Development (2 weeks): We will create the digital platform that hosts your menu and generate custom QR codes that can be placed around your restaurant.

- Phase 3: Testing and Launch (1 week): We will test the digital menu to ensure it's mobile-friendly, functional, and easy to navigate. Once approved, we will proceed with launching the QR code system at your restaurant.
